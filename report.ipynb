    "\n",
    "To find the borders of the map, we decided to use [aruco markers](https://www.uco.es/investiga/grupos/ava/portfolio/aruco/l) - a robust library available for open cv to detect predefined markers in an image used for pose estimation - to mark the corners of our map.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we find the first corner of each four corner markers (markers have ids 1-4). We then apply a perspective transform where we map the four given corners to predefined image of size 350x240 pixel. The choice of the cropped map size is based on the actual size of our image, which is 1050mmx720mm, so every pixel in our cropped map corresponds to 3 mm in reality.\n",

    "The principle can be seen on this image:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/perspective_transform.png\" alt=\"Perspective Transform\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Perspective transform allows us to rectify the map in our image. As the camera looks at the scene with a certain angle, the map appears distorted on the image. The perspective transform projects the map again onto a regular rectangle. It though does not correct for any radial distortion of the camera itself. For this the camera would need to be calibrated but since the precision without this step was sufficient for our purposes, we skipped this step.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Extended Kalman Filter for Robot Localization\n",
    "\n",
    "This report provides an explanation of the implementation of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) used for robot localization. The EKF estimates the robot's position, orientation, and motion parameters based on sensor inputs (camera data) and motor control signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Kalman Filtering\n",
    "The Kalman Filter is a recursive estimation algorithm used to infer the state of a dynamic system. It is particularly effective for systems with noisy measurements and process models. The **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** is a nonlinear extension of the Kalman Filter, suitable for systems where the dynamics or measurement models are nonlinear.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation, the EKF is used to estimate the robot's state vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Position**: \\((x, y)\\) coordinates in the environment\n",
    "- **Orientation**: Angle \\(\\theta\\) (yaw, in radians)\n",
    "- **Velocity**: Linear velocity \\(v\\)\n",
    "- **Angular velocity**: Rate of change of \\(\\theta\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "## EKF Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. State Vector\n",
    "The state vector \\(\\mathbf{\\mu}\\) represents the robot's estimated state at any given time:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\mathbf{\\mu} = [x, y, \\theta, v, \\omega] \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(x, y\\): Current position in pixels\n",
    "- \\(\\theta\\): Current orientation in radians\n",
    "- \\(v\\): Linear velocity (in pixels/second)\n",
    "- \\(\\omega\\): Angular velocity (in radians/second)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Covariance Matrix \\(\\Sigma\\)\n",
    "This is a 5x5 matrix representing the uncertainties in the state vector. Each diagonal element corresponds to the variance of a state variable, and off-diagonal elements represent correlations between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Prediction Step\n",
    "The prediction step uses the robot's motion model to estimate its next state, given its current state and control inputs. The equations for the prediction step are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathbf{\\mu}_{\\text{pred}} = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{\\mu} + \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{u} + \\text{process\\_noise}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(\\mathbf{A}\\): State transition matrix, derived from the Jacobian of the motion model\n",
    "- \\(\\mathbf{B}\\): Control input matrix, based on the robot's kinematic model\n",
    "- \\(\\mathbf{u}\\): Control input vector \\([v, \\omega]\\) (linear and angular velocities)\n",
    "- \\(\\text{process\\_noise}\\): Represents uncertainties in the motion model\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Update Step\n",
    "The update step incorporates measurement data (e.g., camera observations) to refine the state estimate. It corrects the predicted state based on the difference between the predicted and observed measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kalman Gain Calculation:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{\\text{pred}} \\mathbf{H}^T (\\mathbf{H} \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{\\text{pred}} \\mathbf{H}^T + \\mathbf{R})^{-1}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(\\mathbf{K}\\): Kalman Gain, which determines how much the measurements influence the estimate\n",
    "- \\(\\mathbf{H}\\): Measurement matrix (identity matrix in this implementation)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### State Update:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathbf{\\mu}_{\\text{est}} = \\mathbf{\\mu}_{\\text{pred}} + \\mathbf{K} \\left( \\mathbf{y} - h(\\mathbf{\\mu}_{\\text{pred}}) \\right)\n",

    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(\\mathbf{y}\\): Measured state vector from the camera\n",
    "- \\(h(\\mathbf{\\mu}_{\\text{pred}})\\): Predicted measurements based on the current state\n",

    "\n",
    "### Handling Missing Camera Data\n",
    "To handle situations where the camera does not provide valid measurements (e.g., `robot_pose_px` contains NaN values), the EKF relies on the prediction step alone, without updating the state with measurements. In this way, the EKF continues to estimate the robot's state based on motion data, even when external measurements are unavailable.\n"
